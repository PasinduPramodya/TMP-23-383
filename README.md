“Motorbike Defect Checker and Predictor” –Android App to identify  vehicle auto parts altered and their usage prediction
Research Problem
The problem that we have identified is that when an individual tries to purchase a vehicle (Motorbike) he will not be able to identify the defects, auto parts fixed as an alternative to original parts, engine defects, usage of the current tyres, vehicle details and the registration paper details comparison. 
Solution
As a solution, our team has come up with a Mobile Application which is based on the sub-section of Machine Learning (ML) which is called Image Processing and a vast database with all the necessary data regarding auto parts to solve this issue.
Individual Research Questions
How to identify altered parts in a motorbike fixed except original parts?
How to identify defects of an engine by the sound of the engine heard? 
How to identify major details of a motorbike if the details on the motor bike are worn out, rusted, not clear ?
How to identify Motorbike tyer usage and Life expectancy prediction system with computer vision and a machine learning model?
Individual Objectives
Capture images of the auto parts in the vehicle and compare them with the original parts and provide a summary regarding the altered parts. 
Capture the sound of the engine and provide a summary of the engine’s current condition and a prediction of future fault occurrences. 
Capture an image of the Registration paper and compare it to the bike’s original details. 
Capture the images of tyres and predict the usage and possible life expectation.
